#You can add, subtract, etc. variables with simple operators:
a = 2
b = 3
print(a+b) # outputs 5, because 2+3 = 5

#there are a lot of these operators so I wont cover all of them
# If you want to know all the operators, visit https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators_arithmetic.asp

#User input
#to let the user do something, for example, write something, you can just use the input() operation:
input("What is your favourite tupe of food?")  #output: (blank space for user to write something in)
#this is useless right now, but assigning it to a variable makes it possible to write an if statement (You will learn about if statements in 4.)
#you will be able to restrict user input types in 4.
