# Welcome to python!!!
#As you will see later, python is a high level programing language. What that means is that it is very similar to Human language
#Languages like C/C++ are known as medium level languages. They share some elements of Human language but are mostly difficult to understand for a non coder
#Low level languages(At this point Im not even sure they sould be called languages) are languages that humans dont/shouldnt understand. Examples include binary and mashine language. These are just ones and zeros so we dont use them.
#Lets get started!:

#Python relies on indentation('tab') to distinguish between certain types of code instead of semicolons(';') like in other languages.
#When you learn about if statements and loops, you will realise that indentation is necesarry

#If you want to write something to show in the console/output, you can use the print() operator:
print("Hello World!")
#the text has to be in quotes to show it is text

#the print operator can be used on numbers too and many other datatypes(which will be covered later)
print(10)
#This is the beginning of a long, long journey...
